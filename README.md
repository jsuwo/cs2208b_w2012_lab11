CS 2208b - Lab 11
=================

In this lab, we'll iteratively develop a Makefile for building assignment 5 quickly and easily.

Part 1
------

* `Makefile.1`: Getting started with Makefiles
* `Makefile.2`: Suppressing command echoing
* `Makefile.3`: Basic Makefile to run `m4` on `asn5.m` to produce `asn5.s`
* `Makefile.4`: Ignoring errors
* `Makefile.5`: A simple Makefile to build assignment 5 (without any of the functions)
* `Makefile.6`: Oops.. we forgot to include `stringio.s`
* `Makefile.7`: Oops.. we forgot to include `iofunc.o`
* `Makefile.8`: Adding a `clean` target
* `Makefile.9`: Ignoring errors in the `clean` target
* `Makefile.10`: Adding a `realclean` target
* `Makefile.11`: Introducing macros
	
Part 2
------

* `Makefile.12`: Adding in the functions
* `Makefile.13`: Introducing a few special macros
* `Makefile.14`: Inference rules
* `Makefile.15`: Using inference rules to build assignment 5
* `Makefile.16`: Getting a little DRY-er
* `Makefile.17`: A commented, (mostly) finished Makefile to build assignment 5
* `Makefile.18`: Adding a `debug` target
